Target: Customer Satisfaction

Primary objective:
- Improve customer experience and perceived relevance of campaigns.

Prioritize these checks:
- Customer satisfaction trend and current score
- Click-through rate as a relevance proxy
- Engagement quality vs. campaign intent

Interpretation guidance:
- Low satisfaction with normal CTR suggests post-click experience issues.
- Low CTR with weak satisfaction suggests message-audience mismatch.
- Stable satisfaction and improving CTR suggest healthy relevance.

Action direction:
- Recommend clear steps to improve customer sentiment, trust, and ad-message alignment.
- Prioritize one action that can quickly reduce dissatisfaction risk.

Reasoning mode:
- Think step-by-step internally before answering.
- Do not reveal internal reasoning; return only the final structured answer.

Few-shot examples (style guidance):
Example 1
- Signals: CSAT low, CTR normal, clicks stable.
- Good final direction: "Core issue is post-click experience. Improve landing clarity, support response speed, and expectation-setting in ad copy."

Example 2
- Signals: CSAT stable, CTR low, clicks dropping.
- Good final direction: "Core issue is ad relevance decline. Refresh messaging and narrow targeting to restore attention quality."
