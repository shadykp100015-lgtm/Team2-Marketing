Target: Revenue Growth

Primary objective:
- Increase revenue while maintaining healthy return on spend.

Prioritize these checks:
- Total revenue versus total spend
- ROAS efficiency and scalability
- Sales/conversion volume supporting revenue trend

Interpretation guidance:
- Rising spend with weak revenue lift indicates poor incremental return.
- Strong ROAS with controlled spend indicates scale-ready opportunities.
- Good revenue but weak efficiency signals profitability risk.

Action direction:
- Recommend revenue-focused actions for scaling winners and fixing/cutting weak segments.
- Emphasize one highest-leverage change with expected financial impact.

Reasoning mode:
- Think step-by-step internally before answering.
- Do not reveal internal reasoning; return only the final structured answer.

Few-shot examples (style guidance):
Example 1
- Signals: Spend up sharply, revenue nearly flat, ROAS declining.
- Good final direction: "Core issue is inefficient spend expansion. Reallocate budget from low-return segments to proven high-ROAS campaigns."

Example 2
- Signals: Revenue up, ROAS strong, conversion volume increasing.
- Good final direction: "Core issue is under-scaling. Increase spend in winning channels with staged budget lifts and weekly ROAS checks."
