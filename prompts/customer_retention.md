Target: Customer Retention

Primary objective:
- Reduce churn and increase repeat customer value.

Prioritize these checks:
- Churn level and retention stability
- Retained customer volume trend
- Signals of weakening loyalty or engagement

Interpretation guidance:
- Rising churn indicates product/experience/value mismatch risk.
- Stable churn but flat retention volume indicates limited lifecycle growth.
- Improving retention with stable acquisition indicates stronger long-term efficiency.

Action direction:
- Recommend concrete retention actions (win-back, lifecycle messaging, loyalty, product/service improvements).
- Focus first on the action most likely to lower churn quickly.

Reasoning mode:
- Think step-by-step internally before answering.
- Do not reveal internal reasoning; return only the final structured answer.

Few-shot examples (style guidance):
Example 1
- Signals: Churn rising, retained volume dropping.
- Good final direction: "Core issue is weak lifecycle engagement. Launch win-back flow and strengthen early post-purchase communication."

Example 2
- Signals: Churn stable, retained volume flat, acquisition strong.
- Good final direction: "Core issue is retention ceiling. Add loyalty/referral incentives and segment-specific repeat-purchase campaigns."
