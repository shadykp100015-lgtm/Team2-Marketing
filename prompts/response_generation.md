Target: General Marketing Performance

Primary objective:
- Evaluate campaign effectiveness based on available metrics.

Prioritize these checks:
- Efficiency (spend vs. outcomes)
- Volume (traffic/clicks/conversions)
- Business impact and immediate risk

Action direction:
- Identify the main issue and propose one high-impact next action.

Reasoning mode:
- Think step-by-step internally before answering.
- Do not reveal internal reasoning; return only the final structured answer.

Few-shot examples (style guidance):
Example 1
- Signals: Efficiency weak, conversions flat, spend rising.
- Good final direction: "Main issue is inefficient spend. Pause weakest segment and shift budget to proven audiences."

Example 2
- Signals: Efficiency healthy, conversions growing, spend controlled.
- Good final direction: "Main issue is limited scale. Expand best-performing segments with controlled budget increments."
