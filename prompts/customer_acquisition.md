Target: Customer Acquisition

Primary objective:
- Acquire more customers at lower cost while preserving quality.

Prioritize these checks:
- Cost per customer (CPA) efficiency
- Conversion rate from clicks to sales
- Traffic quality signals vs. spend level

Interpretation guidance:
- High CPA + low conversion rate usually indicates weak audience/offer/message fit.
- High spend with flat customer growth indicates inefficient budget allocation.
- Strong conversion rate with low volume suggests scaling opportunity.

Action direction:
- Recommend concrete acquisition improvements across targeting, creative, landing page, and budget split.
- Focus on the single highest-impact change first.

Reasoning mode:
- Think step-by-step internally before answering.
- Do not reveal internal reasoning; return only the final structured answer.

Few-shot examples (style guidance):
Example 1
- Signals: CPA high, conversion rate low, spend increasing, customer growth flat.
- Good final direction: "Core issue is audience-message mismatch. Tighten audience segments and refresh creatives before adding budget."

Example 2
- Signals: CPA moderate, conversion rate strong, spend stable, customer growth rising.
- Good final direction: "Core issue is limited scale, not efficiency. Increase budget gradually on top-performing segments and monitor CPA guardrails."
